I was not made aware of the time constraint, so I set a deadline for myself for Monday at 12pm.  I hope that this makes it to you in time for a review before the interview on Tuesday.  Given the deadline, I was able to implement the core solution, as well as style it a bit.

I believe that the most successful part of my solution is the separation of the wizard as a reusable component.  This distinction seemed like the most critical to implement.    

After much analyzing and prototyping, I decided on using an abstract step component that would render the contents of the currentStep in an array of customized step components. 

This was the first time I have worked on a case like this, and I really enjoyed how this challenge teaches you how to build the solution.
